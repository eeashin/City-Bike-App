### Process of Implementation

**Eashin Matubber**

1. I have started drawing first before implementing to visualise and kind of prototype of the front end what i want to show to use.

2.	Then I select which programming language I am going to use and which library and other related things like it should at-least seems like a full functional application etc. I am going to use React.js.

2.1. Here I also used bootstrap for the app.

3. For the bikestop list page, I will fetch data from the API and and save to state and then render the current state data and return it to show on browser. Most possibly I need to use mapping over current sate data to return those data.

3.1. I tried first to get data straight by response from promise, and then realize it needs to reformat the data in application to access and reuse it for the application.

3.2. To make it looks better may used some table style. 

4. For search page, same way I will fetch data from API and render data by mapping or filtering and then return it in some html page to show to user. 

4.1. To make a noticing search option it may be better to visualize search option with some light and soome bootstrap style.

5. This stage I may need to take user input and also save it in current sate and then create a function to search the match of user input and render it to return. Also, have to fix the error response for invalid search input. 

5.1. I used my programming logic to create function which will search the bike stop and availability of bike.

5.2. I also tried to use logic that if the search input match with any part of the name of the stop it will show the data to user and if the input is completely not found and not partially matched with any stoo name it will show a message to user.

5.3. There is also logic if the use just serach without any input it will show all list.

6. Possibly I am going to use some navigation and routing to make it a real life app and it will have good UX.
